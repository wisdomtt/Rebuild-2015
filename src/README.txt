Why hello there fellow programmer! If you can read this, one of a few things has happened: something has gone horribly wrong
and I'm not here to fix it or you have decided to learn more about programming by reading through past robot code. Hopefully, the 
command based programming paradigm has been passed down, but if it has been replaced by something better(for your sake I hope it is) 
or it has been abandoned as soon as I left, you will have been met with a large mass of confusing as hell files. What this file [removed: is](aside from 
being an unformatted hellish mess) is intended to be in a simple guide to the code and some of the basic concepts behind it.
